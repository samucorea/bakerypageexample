# Example of a bakery webpage.

This was a project to simulate what a client looking for a page for their bakery would want as a final result. I designed this webpage on figma,
and then converted it to html/css following a grid-based layout. On this project I learnt several things:

* **Grid-based webpage.** This was my first time implementing a website 100% based on a grid layout. The grid layout makes it very easy for front-end developers
like myself to convert a design into html/css. With the grid-template i could distribute the different sections of the webpage flawlessly. I also
liked  how easy it was to make it responsive. I encountered some issues with the fr unit and cross-browser compatibility. It wasn't working as expected on Firefox.
However, once I changed the units to vh or % it all worked well.

* I learnt how to implement a nice navbar with slide animation on phone. I learnt it with a Dev Ed video tutorial.

* I learnt about tools to optimize the img sizes that can slowdown the webpage loading speed. The one that I used was https://tinypng.com.

* I also learnt how to implement a google maps widget on any website. I had to setup an account on google cloud platform and request an API key to get it to work. With
their great documentation it wasn't too hard. I could make buttons that would move the map to a specific position based on their latitude and longitude.

## Conclusion

Overall, it was a nice project to make for my portfolio and also for my learning on web development.
